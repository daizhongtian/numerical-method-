# ENUME 2025 – Numerical Methods Assignments

A collection of three MATLAB assignments for the ENUME 2025 numerical methods course.  Each folder contains the original brief, the submitted report, and well-documented MATLAB code that can be executed directly to reproduce the results and figures discussed in the reports.

## Prerequisites

* MATLAB R2023a or later (scripts use `ode45`, `deval`, `fminsearch`, tables, tiled layouts, etc.).
* Signal Processing Toolbox for `filtfilt` (Assignment A).
* Optimization Toolbox is **not** required; all optimisations use the base `fminsearch` function.
* The provided `.mat` and `.csv` data files must remain in their respective assignment folders.

To keep figures and generated tables tidy, run the scripts from within their folder so MATLAB creates output files (for example `mae_vs_h.csv`) next to the script that produced them.

## Quick start

1. Launch MATLAB and change the working directory to one of the assignment folders, e.g.
   ```matlab
   cd('path/to/numerical-method-/Assignment A')
   ```
2. Run the corresponding driver script:
   * **Assignment A:** `complete_solution_no_simplifications` in `finalsolution.m`
   * **Assignment B:** `solution5`
   * **Assignment C:** run the script section-by-section or execute `final solution.m`
3. Inspect the figures and console output described below.  Generated plots summarise the numerical experiments and match the accompanying reports.

## Assignment details

### Assignment A – Left-ankle dorsiflexion from motion capture

* **Goal:** Reconstruct the left ankle dorsiflexion angle from 3D motion-capture markers, contaminate the data with Gaussian noise, and recover the best low-pass filter cutoff by minimising the mean absolute error (MAE) against the clean signal.
* **Key files:**
  * `finalsolution.m` – full pipeline from loading `typical_gait.mat` through frame construction, noise injection, Butterworth filtering and MAE analysis.
  * `lpfilt.m` – helper that performs zero-phase Butterworth filtering (`filtfilt`).
  * `typical_gait.mat` – the gait dataset required by the script.
* **How to run:**
  ```matlab
  complete_solution_no_simplifications
  ```
* **Outputs:**
  * Figures showing the clean, noisy, and filtered angles for each tested cutoff frequency.
  * A plot of MAE versus cutoff frequency and a printed summary of the optimal filter.
  * Optional Monte-Carlo repetition that averages MAE over 100 noise realisations.

### Assignment B – Fourier approximation of an exponential pulse

* **Goal:** Approximate a periodic exponential pulse using truncated Fourier series. Compare coefficients computed with a rectangle rule against MATLAB's `integral`, analyse convergence versus step size, visualise the Gibbs phenomenon, and tabulate the MAE of the coefficients.
* **Key files:**
  * `solution5.m` – main script containing helper functions for the signal definition, numerical integration, and Fourier coefficient calculation.
  * `mae_vs_h.csv` – CSV table generated by the script with MAE statistics for multiple discretisations (will be overwritten on each run).
* **How to run:**
  ```matlab
  solution5
  ```
* **Outputs:**
  * Console tables comparing rectangle-rule coefficients against the integral-based reference values.
  * Multiple figure windows illustrating reconstructions for different truncation orders and the log–log MAE versus step-size trend lines.
  * `mae_vs_h.csv` summarising the mean absolute errors and fitted slopes.

### Assignment C – Extended Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model

* **Goal:** Explore an extended predator–prey model that includes quadratic density terms. Implement three solvers (`ode45`, a Gear2 predictor–corrector, and classical RK4), estimate parameters from observational data via nonlinear least squares, and compare solver accuracy/time trade-offs over a range of tolerances and step sizes.
* **Key files:**
  * `final solution.m` – script containing modular solver implementations (`solverOde45`, `solverGear2`, `solverKutta`) and utilities for parameter estimation (`predatorPreyEstimate`) and benchmarking (`predatorPreyTask3`).
  * `animals_*.csv` – synthetic observation datasets used for fitting and benchmarking.
* **How to run:**
  ```matlab
  run('final solution.m')
  ```
  The script prints progress for Tasks 1–3 and produces plots once each stage completes.
* **Outputs:**
  * Demonstration plots comparing solver trajectories for representative parameters.
  * Console summaries of the estimated parameters and root-mean-square relative errors.
  * Multiple accuracy versus tolerance/step-size figures and wall-clock timing comparisons.

## Reproducing report figures

Each script saves or displays every figure referenced in the corresponding PDF report. If you need to export high-resolution images, use MATLAB's built-in `exportgraphics` or `saveas` functions after the plots appear.

## Troubleshooting

* Ensure the working folder contains the required data files (`typical_gait.mat`, `animals_*.csv`). MATLAB will raise a `load` or `readmatrix` error otherwise.
* If Signal Processing Toolbox is unavailable, replace `lpfilt.m` with an alternative filtering implementation (e.g., using `designfilt` plus `filtfilt`).
* Scripts are designed for reproducibility but rely on random noise (Assignment A). Set the random seed using `rng(seed)` before running if you require identical Monte-Carlo statistics.
